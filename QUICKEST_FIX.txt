QUICKEST FIX - GET YOUR SITE LIVE NOW
=====================================

METHOD 1: BRANCH DEPLOYMENT (30 SECONDS)
-----------------------------------------

This is THE EASIEST way. No workflows, no environment issues.

1. Open this link:
   https://github.com/MShayanNazeer/personal_site-github-pages/settings/pages

2. Look for "Source" dropdown (currently says "GitHub Actions")

3. Click it and select "Deploy from a branch"

4. Two new dropdowns appear:
   - First dropdown: select "main"
   - Second dropdown: select "/ (root)"

5. Click "Save" button

6. DONE! Site will be live in 1-2 minutes at:
   https://MShayanNazeer.github.io/personal_site-github-pages/


METHOD 2: DELETE THE ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------------

If you want to keep using workflows:

1. Open this link:
   https://github.com/MShayanNazeer/personal_site-github-pages/settings/environments

2. Click on "github-pages" 

3. Scroll ALL THE WAY DOWN to the bottom

4. Look for red "Danger Zone" section

5. Click "Delete environment" button

6. Confirm deletion

7. Go to: https://github.com/MShayanNazeer/personal_site-github-pages/actions

8. Click "Re-run all jobs" on the latest workflow

9. Wait 2 minutes - should work now!


WHICH METHOD TO USE?
---------------------

→ Use METHOD 1 (Branch Deployment) if you just want it to work NOW
→ Use METHOD 2 if you want to keep the automated workflow


YOUR SITE URL (after either method):
------------------------------------
https://MShayanNazeer.github.io/personal_site-github-pages/
