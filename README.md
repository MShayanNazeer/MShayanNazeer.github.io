## Local Development

### Testing Locally (No Installation Required)

Since this is now a static site, you don't need Node.js or npm. Simply open the HTML files in a browser, or use any static file server:

**Option 1: Python (Recommended)**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Option 2: Node.js http-server**
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
```

**Option 3: VS Code Live Server**
- Install "Live Server" extension
- Right-click `index.html` â†’ "Open with Live Server"

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Legacy Express.js Server (Optional)

If you still want to run the old Express.js server locally:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start server: `npm start`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

**Note:** The Express.js server is no longer needed for GitHub Pages deployment.

### Navigation

## Content Management

To update the content on the website, you need to modify the JSON files in the `data` directory:

### Managing News

News items are stored in `data/news.json`. The format is:
```json
[
  {
    "date": "Feb 28, 2025",
    "content": "Lightning talk on human in-the-loop for secure digital transactions accepted at the UMass Graduate Research Symposium."
  },
  ...
]
```

The 4 most recent news items appear on the homepage, and all items appear on the News page.

### Managing Research Projects

Research projects are stored in `data/research.json`. The format for each research project is:
```json
{
  "title": "Project Title",
  "description": "Detailed description of the research project.",
  "keyFindings": [
    "First key finding or achievement",
    "Second key finding or achievement",
    "Additional findings..."
  ],
  "collaborators": "Collaborating institutions or researchers",
  "imagePath": "/images/research/project-image.jpg"
}
```

To add a new research project with an image:
1. Place your image in the `public/images/research/` directory
2. Add a new entry to the `research.json` file with the appropriate path to your image
3. The image will be displayed alongside your research description

### Managing Publications

Publications are stored in `data/publications.json`. Add your publications in the format:
```json
{
  "type": "Conference Abbreviation Year",
  "category": "conference",
  "title": "Publication Title",
  "authors": "Author1, Author2, ...",
  "venue": "Conference/Journal Name, Year",
  "links": [
    { "name": "PDF", "url": "link-to-pdf" },
    { "name": "CODE", "url": "link-to-code" }
  ]
}
```

The `category` field can be one of: `conference`, `journal`, `preprint`, or `under-review`. This affects the styling of the publication tag.

### Managing Life Updates

Life content is stored in `data/life.json` with the following structure:
```json
{
  "intro": "Introductory text for the Life page",
  "photography": [
    {
      "imagePath": "/images/photo-filename.jpg",
      "caption": "Caption describing the photo",
      "alt": "Alt text for accessibility"
    }
  ],
  "travel": [
    {
      "location": "Location (Time Period)",
      "description": "Description of travel experience"
    }
  ],
  "reading": [
    {
      "title": "Book Title",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "description": "Brief review or impression of the book"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Interactive World Map

The Life page features an interactive world map that highlights visited countries, U.S. states, and Canadian provinces. The map uses Leaflet.js with authoritative GeoJSON data from Natural Earth and Statistics Canada.

#### Map Features

- **Countries Visited** (Blue): Displays countries you've visited
- **U.S. States Visited** (Red): Shows visited U.S. states  
- **Canadian Provinces Visited** (Green): Highlights visited Canadian provinces
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, clickable popups, zoom controls

#### Adding New Visits

To add new visited locations, open the browser console on the Life page and use these commands:

```javascript
// Add a new visited country
addVisitedCountry('AU', 'Australia')

// Add a new visited U.S. state  
addVisitedUSState('CO', 'Colorado')

// Add a new visited Canadian province
addVisitedCanadianProvince('SK', 'Saskatchewan')
```

#### Map Data Sources

- **World Countries**: Natural Earth Admin 0 boundaries
- **U.S. States**: Natural Earth Admin 1 boundaries
- **Canadian Provinces**: Statistics Canada cartographic boundaries

#### Customization

The visited locations are defined in `public/js/interactive-world-map.js`:
- `visitedCountries` array for country codes
- `visitedUSStates` array for U.S. state abbreviations  
- `visitedCanadianProvinces` array for Canadian province codes

Update these arrays to reflect your travel history.

To add photos to the Life page:
1. Place images in the `public/images/` directory
2. Update the `photography` array in `life.json` with the image paths and captions

### CV Management

To update your CV, replace the file at `public/documents/resume.pdf`.
